# Amplitude Shift Keying Generation Using Bipolar Junction Transitors

## Study on Analog and Digital Communications and VLSI

Software: Multisim

Hardware: ELVIS Measurements

Outcome: We have some disadvantages, we can further go to FSk. But ASK can be generated through passing sinusoidal signal with unipolar binary sequence. 
While ASK can be demodulated through passing modulated signal with rectifier, LPF and comparator then the signal we get will be the message signal which we have given. 
Demodulation can be done through two methods, Asynchronous and synchronous. Like this the signal can be modulated and demodulated using ASK.
